### The Common people don’t want war.

> “Naturally, the common people don’t want war. Neither in England nor in Russia nor for that matter in Germany, that is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country, who determined the policy. And it is always a simple matter to drag people along, whether it is the democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to so is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers, for a lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.” <br><br>  By Hermann Goering


    

### Who was Hermann Goering…

[Hermann Goering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring), was the supreme commander of [Luftwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe), Nazi Germany’s airforce wing. He was considered to be the right-hand man of Adolf Hitler. He successfully commanded many successful German air raids throughout the war, most of the successes in the early stages of the war. He succeeded on all fronts, destroying the Soviet airforce during [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa) and in the Bombing of London. When the Soviet Red Army entered Berlin, it became evident that Berlin would fall. Soon, he started moving to the east thinking it is better to surrender to Americans than get caught by the Soviets. His plan was successful and his life was halted for few days.

He was sentenced to hanging for his war crimes and role in Holocaust in the [Nuremberg trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials). But before, he committed suicide in his prison cell by poisoning himself. The piece above is from an interview given by him to an American journalist. Another strange thing is that the interview is just hours before he took his life.

### Some thoughts…

I think Hermann realised the mistakes of his life as death is approaching him rapidly. Generally, this is the trend in many deaths. What he said is correct and it is the same tactic that is being used by politicians from the old days of Rome to this day, in this modern world. Even though we can access the truth to a great extent, we still fall this prey. Ultimately it’s people who are paying price for the actions of the leaders.

This is not only true to create conflicts between two countries, any two groups in general. The same is happening from America to India. The Black lives matter movement, the persecution of minorities in India. The Muslims of Kashmir, which is the main political problem for India.

The government is not trying to engage with people and create a feeling of belonging or safety and the radical groups are creating a fear of persecution among the youth. This is what Mr Goering said. The only solution to any problem(at least most of them) is just to give access to the truth to everyone. One thing politician and everyone of us should remember is we, the people are the one that are going to pay the prices of war or any conflict in general. So we should be careful and not believe what our politicians say. They think they are doing in the interest of the people, but most of their actions backfire and cause enomorous damage to people.
