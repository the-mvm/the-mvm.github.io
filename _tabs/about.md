My journey in the tech world began in the late '90s, delving into virtual reality and extending to full-body interaction and augmented reality. My coding adventure started with a ZX Spectrum 48K, and I later obtained a Computer Science degree from NOVA University Lisbon.

Although I have spent considerable time using C++, my current go-to coding tool is C#. The majority of my open-source projects can be found under the [NetFabric](https://github.com/NetFabric) organization on GitHub. I've also made contributions to other projects, including well-known ones like [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) and [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).

When I'm not immersed in coding, I find equilibrium by enjoying quality time with my family. I also unwind by engaging in dirt biking on pump tracks and exploring mountain bike trails in my free moments.
